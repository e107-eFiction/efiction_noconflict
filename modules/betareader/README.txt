This little module will let you add an option to the members list page to 
display a list of the betareaders on your site.  It's designed to work with
the default beta-reader field.  If you've installed a custom betareader 
module make sure the name of the field is "betareader" and that it's a 
yes/no field.  Otherwise, this module won't work.

eFiction installation.
